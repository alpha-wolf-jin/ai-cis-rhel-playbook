=== DATA COLLECTION SUMMARY ===

**Requirement 1: Collect OS distribution, version, and architecture information**
- Status: YES
- Data Found: OS is Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.7 (Plow). Full `/etc/os-release` output provided.
- Notes: Architecture information (e.g., x86_64) was not explicitly shown in the output, but `uname -a` was part of the command. The output shown is only from `/etc/os-release`.

**Requirement 2: Collect the installed version of Ansible Automation Platform and its components**
- Status: NO
- Data Found: The `rpm -qa` command returned empty output (no packages found).
- Notes: This indicates AAP components are not installed via RPM on this system.

**Requirement 3: Collect the installed version and location of the ansible-builder tool**
- Status: PARTIAL
- Data Found: `ansible-builder` was not found in the standard PATH (`which` and `--version` failed). However, a file was later found at `/home/jin/ai/generate-palybook/.venv/bin/ansible-builder`.
- Notes: The version of this specific binary was not checked. The initial check concluded "not found," but a subsequent task (Req 4 in part10) found a potential binary in a user's virtual environment.

**Requirement 4: Gather information about any recent ansible-builder execution attempts, including command history or logs**
- Status: PARTIAL
- Data Found: No relevant commands found in shell history (`~/.bash_history`). No entries in `journalctl`. A log file check found the binary path mentioned in Req 3.
- Notes: The check confirms no recent `ansible-builder` execution attempts were logged via the methods checked. The found "log file" is actually the binary itself.

**Requirement 5: Retrieve the content of any ansible-builder definition files (e.g., execution-environment.yml) present on the system**
- Status: YES
- Data Found: Multiple `execution-environment.yml` files were found, primarily in `/usr/share/ansible/collections/ansible_collections/`. Full contents of 14 files were collected.
- Notes: These are collection-level definition files, not necessarily user-created project files for a failing build.

**Requirement 6: Collect the base image specified in any found ansible-builder definition files**
- Status: NO
- Data Found: The search command looked for `base_image` or `from:` lines in YAML files containing "ansible-builder" or "execution-environment" in their path. It scanned unrelated Ansible playbooks (the verification playbooks themselves) and a settings template, finding no base image.
- Notes: The search methodology was flawed. It did not examine the actual `execution-environment.yml` files found in Requirement 5, which contain `EE_BASE_IMAGE` or `images.base_image.name` fields.

**Requirement 7: Gather logs from recent ansible-builder build processes, specifically looking for error output**
- Status: NO
- Data Found: `journalctl -u ansible-builder` returned "-- No entries --". No specific builder log files were found.
- Notes: Consistent with Req 4, indicating no recent `ansible-builder` service or process logs.

**Requirement 8: Collect the output of any system package manager (yum/dnf) commands related to libsystemd or pkg-config packages**
- Status: NO
- Data Found: The `dnf list installed | grep` command returned empty output.
- Notes: The command only checked for *installed* packages. It did not check if the packages are available in repositories or attempt to install them, which is relevant to the KCS error.

**Requirement 9: Retrieve the current PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable value**
- Status: YES
- Data Found: The `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable is not set (empty output).
- Notes: Data successfully collected.

**Requirement 10: Collect the version and status of the podman or docker service, if applicable**
- Status: NO
- Data Found: The check for `podman` or `docker` systemd services found none. No version or status data was collected.
- Notes: The command only checked for systemd services named `podman.service` or `docker.service`. It did not check if the binaries are installed and runnable without a service (e.g., `podman --version`).

**Requirement 11: Retrieve the list of locally available container images, particularly those from registry.redhat.io**
- Status: NO
- Data Found: Command `podman images --all` and `docker images --all` failed, outputting "No container runtime found".
- Notes: Indicates neither Podman nor Docker is installed or operational on the system.

=== OVERALL STATUS ===
- Total Requirements: 11
- Fully Collected: 3 (Req 1, 5, 9)
- Partially Collected: 2 (Req 3, 4)
- Not Collected: 6 (Req 2, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11)

**Critical Analysis Against KCS Problem:**
The collected data reveals a system that does **not** match the expected environment for the reported KCS issue. The core problem involves `ansible-builder` failing when using a specific RHEL 8 base image. Key findings contradict this scenario:
1.  **OS Mismatch:** The system is RHEL 9.7, not RHEL 8.
2.  **AAP Not Installed:** No AAP components (including `ansible-builder`) are installed via system packages.
3.  **Container Runtime Absent:** No Podman/Docker is installed, making container image builds impossible.
4.  **No Build Activity:** No history, logs, or evidence of recent `ansible-builder` execution.

The only hint of `ansible-builder` is a file inside a user's Python virtual environment, suggesting a potential manual pip install or development environment, not a supported AAP installation. Therefore, the data collection confirms the described error **cannot be occurring on this specific system** in its current state. The investigation should focus on why this playbook was run against a non-conforming host or if the user is attempting to use an unsupported `ansible-builder` installation method.
