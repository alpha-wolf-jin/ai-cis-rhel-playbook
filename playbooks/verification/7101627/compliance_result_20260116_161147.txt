=== COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS REPORT ===

**Requirement 1: Measure if Ansible Automation Platform version matches: 2.5**
- Status: **NOT MET**
- Evidence: Requirement 2 of the data collection found no AAP components installed via RPM (`rpm -qa` returned empty). The system shows no evidence of an AAP 2.5 installation.
- Recommendation: Verify the target system. The playbook may have been run on the wrong host, or AAP may be installed via an unsupported method (e.g., containers). If investigating the KCS issue, target a system with a confirmed AAP 2.5 installation.

**Requirement 2: Measure if ansible-builder is being used to build a custom Execution Environment (EE)**
- Status: **NOT MET**
- Evidence: Requirement 4 found no evidence of recent `ansible-builder` execution in shell history or system logs. Requirement 11 confirms no container runtime (Podman/Docker) is installed, making an EE build impossible on this system.
- Recommendation: The condition of "being used to build" is not met. Investigate if the user attempted a build on a different system or if the `ansible-builder` binary in the virtual environment was used elsewhere.

**Requirement 3: Measure if the base EE image used in the build matches: registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform-25/ee-supported-rhel8:latest**
- Status: **UNABLE TO DETERMINE**
- Evidence: While multiple `execution-environment.yml` files were found (Req 5), the specific search for the base image (Req 6) was flawed and did not examine their contents. Therefore, the presence or absence of the specified base image in any project definition cannot be confirmed from the provided data.
- Recommendation: Re-run a proper search on the contents of the found `execution-environment.yml` files for strings like `ee-supported-rhel8` or the full image name.

**Requirement 4: Measure if the ansible-builder build process fails with an error during the 'python setup.py egg_info' stage**
- Status: **NOT MET**
- Evidence: Requirement 7 found no builder logs (`journalctl -u ansible-builder` returned no entries). There is no data indicating any build process, successful or failed, occurred on this system.
- Recommendation: Without build logs or execution history, this requirement cannot be verified as occurring.

**Requirement 5: Measure if the build error output contains the specific string: 'Cannot find libsystemd or libsystemd-journal:'**
- Status: **NOT MET**
- Evidence: As with Requirement 4, no build logs or error output were collected (Req 7). The absence of build activity means this specific error string cannot be present.
- Recommendation: Collect data from a system where the build failure is actively occurring.

**Requirement 6: Measure if the build error output contains the specific string: 'Package libsystemd was not found in the pkg-config search path.'**
- Status: **NOT MET**
- Evidence: Same as Requirement 5. No build output was found to contain any error strings.
- Recommendation: Same as Requirement 5.

=== COMPLIANCE SUMMARY ===
- Total Requirements: 6
- MET: 0
- NOT MET: 5 (Req 1, 2, 4, 5, 6)
- UNABLE TO DETERMINE: 1 (Req 3)

=== OVERALL COMPLIANCE STATUS ===
**NON-COMPLIANT**

The system's state, as revealed by the data collection, does not satisfy the core preconditions for the KCS issue. The majority of matching requirements are definitively **NOT MET**.

=== KEY FINDINGS ===
1.  **Environment Mismatch:** The target system is RHEL 9.7, while the KCS issue is specific to a RHEL 8 base image. AAP 2.5 is not installed via standard packages.
2.  **Missing Prerequisites:** A container runtime (Podman/Docker) is not installed, which is a fundamental requirement for building Execution Environments with `ansible-builder`. This alone makes the reported failure scenario impossible on this host.
3.  **No Activity Evidence:** There is no historical or log evidence that `ansible-builder` was recently executed, let alone that it failed.
4.  **Isolated Binary:** The only trace of `ansible-builder` is a binary within a user's Python virtual environment, indicating a potential unofficial installation, not the AAP-provided tool.

**Recommendation:** The investigation should pivot. This data collection confirms the described error is **not occurring on this system**. Next steps should include:
*   Verifying the correct system for troubleshooting the KCS issue.
*   If the intent was to *proactively* check for the issue, the report confirms the system is not vulnerable as the necessary components (AAP 2.5, container runtime) are absent.
*   Clarifying the purpose of the `ansible-builder` binary in the virtual environment, as it does not represent a supported AAP installation.
