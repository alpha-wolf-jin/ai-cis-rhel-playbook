On the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp (as with tmpfs) will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily.\nAnother alternative is to create a dedicated partition for /tmp from a separate volume or disk.

Notice that these counters also include shared memory. The most reliable way to get the count is using df and du.\ntmpfs has three mount options for sizing:\n• size: The limit of allocated bytes for this tmpfs instance. The default is half of your physical RAM without swap. If you oversize your tmpfs instances the machine will deadlock since the OOM handler will not be able to free that memory.\n• nr_blocks: The same as size, but in blocks of PAGE_SIZE.\n• nr_inodes: The maximum number of inodes for this instance. The default is half of the number of your physical RAM pages, or (on a machine with highmem) the number of lowmem RAM pages, whichever is the lower.\nThese parameters accept a suffix k, m or g and can be changed on remount. The size parameter also accepts a suffix % to limit this tmpfs instance to that percentage of your physical RAM.

    "impact": "Mandatory Access Control limits the capabilities of applications and daemons on a system, while this can prevent unauthorized access the configuration of MAC can be complex and difficult to implement correctly preventing legitimate access from occurring.\nInternal Only - General\n1.3.1 Configure SELinux\nSELinux implements Mandatory Access Control (MAC). Every process and system resource has a special security label called an SELinux context. An SELinux context, sometimes referred to as an SELinux label, is an identifier which abstracts away the system-level details and focuses on the security properties of the entity. Not only does this provide a consistent way of referencing objects in the SELinux policy, but it also removes any ambiguity that can be found in other identification methods. For example, a file can have multiple valid path names on a system that makes use of bind mounts.\nThe SELinux policy uses these contexts in a series of rules which define how processes can interact with each other and the various system resources. By default, the policy does not allow any interaction unless a rule explicitly grants access.\nIn Fedora Family Linux distributions, system services are controlled by the systemd daemon; systemd starts and stops all services, and users and processes communicate with systemd using the systemctl utility. The systemd daemon can consult the SELinux policy and check the label of the calling process and the label of the unit file that the caller tries to manage, and then ask SELinux whether or not the caller is allowed the access. This approach strengthens access control to critical system capabilities, which include starting and stopping system services.\nThis automatically limits the damage that the software can do to files accessible by the calling user. The user does not need to take any action to gain this benefit. For an action to occur, both the traditional DAC permissions must be satisfied as well as the\nSELinux MAC rules. The action will not be allowed if either one of these models does not permit the action. In this way, SELinux rules can only make a system's permissions more restrictive and secure. SELinux requires a complex policy to allow all the actions required of a system under normal operation.\nTwo such policies have been designed for use with Fedora Family Linux distributions and are included with the system:\n• targeted - Targeted processes run in their own domain, called a confined domain. In a confined domain, the files that a targeted process has access to are limited. If a confined process is compromised by an attacker, the attacker’s access to resources and the possible damage they can do is also limited.\nSELinux denies access to these resources and logs the denial.\n• mls - Implements Multi-Level Security (MLS), which introduces even more kinds of labels (sensitivity and category) and rules that govern access based on these.\nThis section provides guidance for the configuration of the targeted policy.\nNote:\n• Remember that SELinux policy rules are checked after DAC rules. SELinux policy rules are not used if DAC rules deny access first, which means that no\nSELinux denial is logged if the traditional DAC rules prevent the access.\nInternal Only - General\n• This section only applies if SELinux is in use on the system. Additional\nMandatory Access Control systems exist.\n• To avoid incorrect SELinux labeling and subsequent problems, ensure that you start services using a systemctl start command.",

The fips- mode-setup tool, which switches the RHEL system into FIPS mode, uses this policy internally. Switching to the FIPS policy does not guarantee compliance with the FIPS 140 standard.

In contrast, non-source routed packets travel a path determined by routers in the network. In some cases, systems may not be routable or reachable from some locations (e.g. private addresses vs. Internet routable), and so source routed packets would need to be used.",

Assume this system was capable of routing packets to Internet routable addresses on one interface and private addresses on another interface. Assume that the private addresses were not routable to the Internet routable addresses and vice versa. Under normal routing circumstances, an attacker from the Internet routable addresses could not use the system as a way to reach the private address systems.

When a data packet moves into or out of a protected network space, its contents (in particular, information about its origin, target, and the protocol it plans to use) are tested against the firewall rules to see if it should be allowed through To provide a Host Based Firewall, the Linux kernel includes support for NFTables. NFTables is subsystem of the Linux kernel providing filtering and classification of network packets/datagrams/frames. NFTables replaces parts of Netfilter, while keeping and reusing most of it. NFTables utilizes the building blocks of the Netfilter infrastructure, such as the existing hooks into the networking stack, connection tracking system, userspace queueing component, and logging subsystem. In order to configure firewall rules for NFTables, a firewall utility needs to be installed. Guidance has been included for firewalld which provides firewall features by acting as a front-end for the Linux kernel's netfilter framework via the NFTables backend. firewalld acts as a front-end for the Linux kernel's netfilter framework via the NFTables userspace utility, acting as an alternative to the nft command line program. firewalld supports both IPv4 and IPv6 networks and can administer separate firewall zones with varying degrees of trust as defined in zone profiles. This Benchmark includes guidance for configuring NFTables though the firewalld front end utility. If your organization is using a different Host Based Firewall, or a different utility to configure the Host Based Firewall, we recommend verifying that your site's configuration meets the Recommendations in this section, otherwise this section may be skipped. Note: • Only one method should be used to configure a firewall on the system. Use of more than one method could produce unexpected results. • NFTables is the default packet filtering framework. Though IPTables is still supported, this support is done indirectly through firewalld's ability to translate IPTables commands to NFTables. • This section is intended only to ensure the resulting firewall rules are in place. • The ipset and iptables-nft packages are deprecated. This includes deprecation of nft-variants such as iptables, ip6tables, arptables, and ebtables utilities. If you are using any of these tools, for example, because you upgraded from an earlier version, we recommend migrating to using the NFTables package for backend services. Internal Only - General\n4.1 Configure firewalld\nIn order to configure firewall rules for Netfilter or nftables, a firewall utility needs to be installed. firewalld is the recommended utility and is the only guidance provided in this recommendation.\nfirewalld uses the concepts of zones and services, that simplify the traffic management. Zones are predefined sets of rules that cover all necessary settings to allow or deny incoming traffic for a specific service and zone. It provides these features by acting as a front-end for the Linux kernel's netfilter framework via the nftables userspace utility, acting as an alternative to the nft command line program. firewalld supports both IPv4 and IPv6 networks and can administer separate firewall zones with varying degrees of trust as defined in zone profiles.\nImportant: Configuration of a live systems firewall directly over a remote connection will often result in being locked out. It is advised to have a known good firewall configuration set to run on boot and to configure an entire firewall structure in a script that is then run and tested before saving to boot.\nThe following example will create a firewalld zone called securezone to implement the firewall rules of this section leveraging the firewalld utility included with the firewalld package. This example will open port 22(ssh) from anywhere. Opening service SSH should be updated in accordance with local site policy. If another name for the zone is preferred, replace securezone with the name to be used.\nInternal Only - General\nSample securezone zone xml file\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<zone target=\"DROP\">\n  <description>For use with CIS Linux Benchmark.

It is strongly recommended that sites abandon older clear-text login protocols and use SSH to prevent session hijacking and sniffing of sensitive data off the network.\nThe recommendations in this section only apply if the SSH daemon is installed on the system, if remote access is not required the SSH daemon can be removed and this section skipped.\nsshd_config:\n• The openSSH daemon configuration directives, Include and Match, may cause the audits in this section's recommendations to report incorrectly. It is recommended that these options only be used if they're needed and fully understood. If these options are configured in accordance with local site policy, they should be accounted for when following the recommendations in this section.\n• The audits of the running configuration in this section are run in the context of the root user, the local host name, and the local host's IP address. If a Match block exists that matches one of these criteria, the output of the audit will be from the match block. The respective matched criteria should be replaced with a non- matching substitution.\n• Include:\no Include the specified configuration file(s).\no Multiple pathnames may be specified and each pathname may contain glob(7) wildcards that will be expanded and processed in lexical order.\no Files without absolute paths are assumed to be in /etc/ssh/.\no An Include directive may appear inside a Match block to perform conditional inclusion.\n• Match:\no Introduces a conditional block. If all of the criteria on the Match line are satisfied, the keywords on the following lines override those set in the global section of the config file, until either another Match line or the end of the file. If a keyword appears in multiple Match blocks that are satisfied, only the first instance of the keyword is applied.\no The arguments to Match are one or more criteria-pattern pairs or the single token All which matches all criteria. The available criteria are User,\nGroup, Host, LocalAddress, LocalPort, and Address.\no The match patterns may consist of single entries or comma-separated lists and may use the wildcard and negation operators described in the\nPATTERNS section of ssh_config(5).\no The patterns in an Address criteria may additionally contain addresses to match in CIDR address/masklen format, such as 192.0.2.0/24 or\n2001:db8::/32. Note that the mask length provided must be consistent with the address - it is an error to specify a mask length that is too long for\nInternal Only - General\nthe address or one with bits set in this host portion of the address. For example, 192.0.2.0/33 and 192.0.2.0/8, respectively.\no Only a subset of keywords may be used on the lines following a Match keyword. Available keywords are available in the ssh_config man page.\n• Once all configuration changes have been made to /etc/ssh/sshd_config or any included configuration files, the sshd configuration must be reloaded\nCommand to re-load the SSH daemon configuration:\n# systemctl reload-or-restart sshd\nsshd command:\n• -T - Extended test mode. Check the validity of the configuration file, output the effective configuration to stdout and then exit. Optionally, Match rules may be applied by specifying the connection parameters using one or more -C options.\nThe configuration does not contain the system-wide crypto-policy configuration.\nTo show the most accurate runtime configuration, use:\n source /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/opensshserver.config\n source /etc/sysconfig/sshd\n sshd -T $OPTIONS $CRYPTO_POLICY • -C - connection_spec. Specify the connection parameters to use for the -T extended test mode. If provided, any Match directives in the configuration file that would apply are applied before the configuration is written to standard output. The connection parameters are supplied as keyword=value pairs and may be supplied in any order, either with multiple -C options or as a comma-separated list. The keywords are addr, user, host, laddr, lport, and rdomain and correspond to source address, user, resolved source host name, local address, local port number and routing domain respectively.

    "id": "5.1.9",
    "description": "Note: To clarify, the two settings described below are only meant for idle connections from a protocol perspective and are not meant to check if the user is active or not. An idle user does not mean an idle connection. SSH does not and never had, intentionally, the capability to drop idle users. In SSH versions before 8.2p1 there was a bug that caused these values to behave in such a manner that they were abused to disconnect idle users. This bug has been resolved in 8.2p1 and thus it can no longer be abused to disconnect idle users.\nThe two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of SSH sessions. Taken directly from man 5 sshd_config:\n• ClientAliveInterval Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd(8) will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client.\n• ClientAliveCountMax Sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd(8) receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the session. It is important to note that the use of client alive messages is very different from TCPKeepAlive. The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore will not be spoofable. The TCP keepalive option enabled by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable.\nThe client alive mechanism is valuable when the client or server depend on knowing when a connection has become unresponsive. The default value is 3. If\nClientAliveInterval is set to 15, and ClientAliveCountMax is left at the default, unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds.\nSetting a zero ClientAliveCountMax disables connection termination.\nInternal Only - General",
    "rationale": "In order to prevent resource exhaustion, appropriate values should be set for both\nClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax. Specifically, looking at the source code, ClientAliveCountMax must be greater than zero in order to utilize the ability of\nSSH to drop idle connections. If connections are allowed to stay open indefinitely, this can potentially be used as a DDOS attack or simple resource exhaustion could occur over unreliable networks.\nThe example set here is a 45 second timeout.

These arguments allow the PAM configuration files for particular programs to use a common PAM module but in different ways.\nInvalid arguments are ignored and do not otherwise affect the success or failure of the\nPAM module. When an invalid argument is passed, an error is usually written to /var/log/messages file. However, since the reporting method is controlled by the PAM module, the module must be written correctly to log the error to this file.\nInternal Only - General\n5.3.3.1 Configure pam_faillock module\nfaillock.conf provides a way to configure the default settings for locking the user after multiple failed authentication attempts. This file is read by the pam_faillock module and is the preferred method over configuring pam_faillock directly.\nThe file has a very simple name = value format with possible comments starting with # character. The whitespace at the beginning of line, end of line, and around the = sign is ignored.\nOptions:\n• <dir=/path/to/tally-directory> - The directory where the user files with the failure records are kept. The default is /var/run/faillock. Note: These files will disappear after reboot on systems configured with directory /var/run/faillock mounted on virtual memory.\n• audit - Will log the user name into the system log if the user is not found.\n• silent - Don't print informative messages to the user. Please note that when this option is not used there will be difference in the authentication behavior for users which exist on the system and non-existing users.\n• no_log_info - Don't log informative messages via syslog(3).\n• local_users_only - Only track failed user authentications attempts for local users in /etc/passwd and ignore centralized (AD, IdM, LDAP, etc.) users. The faillock(8) command will also no longer track user failed authentication attempts.\nEnabling this option will prevent a double-lockout scenario where a user is locked out locally and in the centralized mechanism.\n• nodelay - Don't enforce a delay after authentication failures.\n• deny=<n> - Deny access if the number of consecutive authentication failures for this user during the recent interval exceeds . The default is 3.\n• fail_interval=n - The length of the interval during which the consecutive authentication failures must happen for the user account lock out is n seconds.\nThe default is 900 (15 minutes).\n• unlock_time=n - The access will be re-enabled after n seconds after the lock out. The value 0 has the same meaning as value never - the access will not be re-enabled without resetting the faillock entries by the faillock(8) command. The default is 600 (10 minutes).

In Linux, the default permissions for any newly created directory is 0777 (rwxrwxrwx), and for any newly created file it is 0666 (rw-rw- rw-). The umask modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting (masking) these permissions. The umask is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the umask are cleared in the resulting file mode.\numask can be set with either Octal or Symbolic values:\n• Octal (Numeric) Value - Represented by either three or four digits. ie umask\n0027 or umask 027. If a four digit umask is used, the first digit is ignored. The remaining three digits effect the resulting permissions for user, group, and world/other respectively.\n• Symbolic Value - Represented by a comma separated list for User u, group g, and world/other o. The permissions listed are not masked by umask. ie a umask set by umask u=rwx,g=rx,o= is the Symbolic equivalent of the Octal umask\n027.

Not only does centralized logging help sites correlate events that may be occurring on multiple systems, but having a second copy of the system log information may be critical after a system compromise where the attacker has modified the local log files on the affected system(s). If a log correlation system is deployed, configure it to process the logs described in this section.\nBecause it is often necessary to correlate log information from many different systems\n(particularly after a security incident) it is recommended that the time be synchronized among systems and devices connected to the local network. The standard Internet protocol for time synchronization is the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is supported by most network-ready devices. Reference <http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/> manual page for more information on configuring chrony.\nIt is important that all logs described in this section be monitored on a regular basis and correlated to determine trends. A seemingly innocuous entry in one log could be more significant when compared to an entry in another log.\nNote on log file permissions: There really isn't a \"one size fits all\" solution to the permissions on log files. Many sites utilize group permissions so that administrators who are in a defined security group, such as \"wheel\" do not have to elevate privileges to root in order to read log files. Also, if a third party log aggregation tool is used, it may need to have group permissions to read the log files, which is preferable to having it run setuid to root. Therefore, there are two remediation and audit steps for log file permissions.\nOne is for systems that do not have a secured group method implemented that only permits root to read the log files (root:root 600). The other is for sites that do have such a setup and are designated as root:securegrp 640 where securegrp is the defined security group (in some cases wheel).\nInternal Only - General\n6.1 Configure Integrity Checking\nAIDE is a file integrity checking tool. While it cannot prevent intrusions, it can detect unauthorized changes to configuration files by alerting when the files are changed.\nWhen setting up AIDE, decide internally what the site policy will be concerning integrity checking. Review the AIDE quick start guide and AIDE documentation before proceeding.\nNote: - IF - another local site approved solution is used, and configured to provide the capabilities covered by AIDE in this section, this section may be skipped.\nInternal Only - General"

A centralized log server provides a single point of entry for further analysis, monitoring and filtering.\nSecurity principals for logging\n• Ensure transport layer security is implemented between the client and the log server.\n• Ensure that logs are rotated as per the environment requirements.\n• Ensure all locally generated logs have the appropriate permissions.\n• Ensure all security logs are sent to a remote log server.\n• Ensure the required events are logged.\nWhat is covered\nThis section will cover the minimum best practices for the usage of either rsyslog or journald. The recommendations are written such that each is wholly independent of each other and only one is implemented.\n• If your organization makes use of an enterprise wide logging system completely outside of rsyslog or journald, then the following recommendations do not directly apply. However, the principals of the recommendations should be followed regardless of what solution is implemented. If the enterprise solution incorporates either of these tools, careful consideration should be given to the following recommendations to determine exactly what applies.\n• Should your organization make use of both rsyslog and journald, take care how the recommendations may or may not apply to you.\nWhat is not covered\n• Enterprise logging systems not utilizing rsyslog or journald. As logging is very situational and dependent on the local environment, not everything can be covered here.\n• Transport layer security should be applied to all remote logging functionality.\nBoth rsyslog and journald supports secure transport and should be configured as such.\n• The log server. There are a multitude of reasons for a centralized log server (and keeping a short period of logging on the local system), but the log server is out of scope for these recommendations.\nInternal Only - General\n6.2.1 Configure journald\nIncluded in the systemd suite is a journaling service called systemd- journald.service for the collection and storage of logging data. It creates and maintains structured, indexed journals based on logging information that is received from a variety of sources such as:\n• Classic RFC3164 BSD syslog via the /dev/log socket\n• STDOUT/STDERR of programs via StandardOutput=journal +\nStandardError=journal in service files (both of which are default settings)\n• Kernel log messages via the /dev/kmsg device node\n• Audit records via the kernel’s audit subsystem\n• Structured log messages via journald’s native protocol\nAny changes made to the systemd-journald configuration will require a re-start of systemd-journald\nInternal Only - General\n6.2.1.1 Configure systemd-journald service\nsystemd-journald is a system service that collects and stores logging data. It creates and maintains structured, indexed journals based on logging information that is received from a variety of sources:\n• Kernel log messages, via kmsg\n• Simple system log messages, via the libc syslog call\n• Structured system log messages via the native Journal API\n• Standard output and standard error of service units\n• Audit records, originating from the kernel audit subsystem\nThe daemon will implicitly collect numerous metadata fields for each log messages in a secure and unfakeable way. See systemd.journal-fields man page for more information about the collected metadata.\nThe journal service stores log data either persistently below /var/log/journal or in a volatile way below /run/log/journal/. By default, log data is stored persistently if\n/var/log/journal/ exists during boot, with an implicit fallback to volatile storage. Use\nStorage= in journald.conf to configure where log data is placed, independently of the existence of /var/log/journal/.\nOn systems where /var/log/journal/ does not exist but where persistent logging is desired, and the default journald.conf is used, it is sufficient to create the directory and ensure it has the correct access modes and ownership.\nInternal Only - General"

Current versions of rsyslog do not suffer from this (historical) performance impact.\no This new style format is specifically targeted towards more advanced use cases like forwarding to remote hosts that might be partially offline.\n• obsolete legacy - previously known simply as the legacy format, this format is exactly what its name implies: it is obsolete and should not be used when writing new configurations. It was created in the early days (up to rsyslog version 5)\nwhere we expected that rsyslog would extend sysklogd just mildly. Consequently, it was primarily aimed at small additions to the original sysklogd format.\no Practice has shown that it was notoriously hard to use for more advanced use cases, and thus we replaced it with the advanced format.\no In essence, everything that needs to be written on a single line that starts with a dollar sign is legacy format.

These controls will enforce the principle that only authorized individuals should have access to the information based on their need to access the information as a part of their responsibilities.\n● ● ●\nInternal Only - General\n6.3 System Auditing\nThe Linux Auditing System operates on a set of rules that collects certain types of system activity to facilitate incident investigation, detect unauthorized access or modification of data. By default events will be logged to /var/log/audit/audit.log, which can be configured in /etc/audit/auditd.conf.\nThe following types of audit rules can be specified:\n• Control rules: Configuration of the auditing system.\n• File system rules: Allow the auditing of access to a particular file or a directory.\nAlso known as file watches.\n• System call rules: Allow logging of system calls that any specified program makes.\nAudit rules can be set:\n• On the command line using the auditctl utility. These rules are not persistent across reboots.\n• In /etc/audit/audit.rules. These rules have to be merged and loaded before they are active.\nNote:\n• For 64 bit systems that have arch as a rule parameter, you will need two rules:\none for 64 bit and one for 32 bit systems calls. For 32 bit systems, only one rule is needed.\n• If the auditing system is configured to be locked (-e 2), a system reboot will be required in order to load any changes.\n• Key names are optional on the rules and will not be used in compliance auditing.\nThe usage of key names is highly recommended as it facilitates organization and searching; as such, all remediation steps will have key names supplied.\n• It is best practice to store the rules, in number prepended files, in /etc/audit/rules.d/. Rules must end in a .rules suffix. This then requires the use of augenrules to merge all the rules into /etc/audit/audit.rules based on their alphabetical (lexical) sort order. All benchmark recommendations follow this best practice for remediation, specifically using the prefix of 50 which is center weighed if all rule sets make use of the number prepending naming convention.\n• Your system may have been customized to change the default UID_MIN. All sample output uses 1000, but this value will not be used in compliance auditing.\nTo confirm the UID_MIN for your system, run the following command: awk\n'/^\\s*UID_MIN/{print $2}' /etc/login.defs\nNormalization The Audit system normalizes some entries, so when you look at the sample output keep in mind that:\nInternal Only - General\n• With regards to users whose login UID is not set, the values -1 / unset /\n4294967295 are equivalent and normalized to -1.\n• When comparing field types and both sides of the comparison is valid fields types, such as euid!=uid, then the auditing system may normalize such that the output is uid!=euid.\n• Some parts of the rule may be rearranged whilst others are dependent on previous syntax. For example, the following two statements are the same:\n-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -C uid!=euid -F auid!=-1 -F key=user_emulation and\n-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -C euid!=uid -F auid!=unset -S execve -k user_emulation\nCapacity planning\nThe recommendations in this section implement auditing policies that not only produce large quantities of logged data, but may also negatively impact system performance.\nCapacity planning is critical in order not to adversely impact production environments.\n• Disk space. If a significantly large set of events are captured, additional on system or off system storage may need to be allocated. If the logs are not sent to a remote log server, ensure that log rotation is implemented else the disk will fill up and the system will halt. Even when logs are sent to a log server, ensure sufficient disk space to allow caching of logs in the case of temporary network outages.\n• Disk IO. It is not just the amount of data collected that should be considered, but the rate at which logs are generated.\n• CPU overhead. System call rules might incur considerable CPU overhead. Test the systems open/close syscalls per second with and without the rules to gauge the impact of the rules.\nInternal Only - General\n6.3.1 Configure auditd Service\nThe capturing of system events provides system administrators with information to allow them to determine if unauthorized access to their system is occurring.\nInternal Only - General"
